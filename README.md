## üìï Introduction 
This GitHub repository integrates various spike-based image reconstruction methods. It aims to assist in comparing the performance of previous approaches on the standard REDS dataset, Real-spike dataset, or a single spike sequence.

## üï∂ Methods
In this repository, we currently support the following methods: TFP<sup>[1]</sup>, TFI<sup>[1]</sup>, TFSTP<sup>[2]</sup>, Spk2ImgNet<sup>[3]</sup>, SSML<sup>[4]</sup>, and WGSE<sup>[5]</sup>, which take 41 spike frames as the input and reconstruct one sharp image.

## üìû Contact
Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact [mrchenkang@stu.pku.edu.cn](mailto:mrchenkang@stu.pku.edu.cn).

## üôá‚Äç Acknowledgment
The implementations of TFP, TFI and TFSTP are from the [SpikeCV](https://spikecv.github.io/). Other methods are implemented according to the paper official repository. We appreciate the effort of the contributors to these repositories.
